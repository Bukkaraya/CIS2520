THIS PROGRAM USES INSERTSORTED FROM THE LINKED LIST API

The program checks if the user has entered a proper file name.
If it is an improper file then the user is asked to enter a file name
until a proper file has been entered

The linked list API is used throughout the main
and it is used to add the cars to the respective list.

The simulation starts at the first second and the traffic signal
changes every 14 seconds and continues to run until all cars have
left the intersection

##########

To run main program:
- make and change directory to bin and run using ./main <file_location>

To run test program:
- make and change directory to bin and run using ./testMain

make clean - to clean object and binary files

Testing file for the simulation are located in the assets folder

##########

This program makes use for the insertSorted function from the main linked list api

##########

Only 1 traffic signal can be green at a time making it easy to process a simulation
The simulation is not real time and we run it after the end of each second
Cars will not turn right during a red light unlike a real intersection
If it is yellow a left turn can only be done on the first second of the yellow
If a car finished with a decimal in it's time then the next car will wait until time is an integer
