The program checks if the user has entered the proper files name.
If file does not exist then the user is prompted to enter a file name until 
a proper file name has been entered.

The PriorityQueue is a extension on the linked list API used in the previous 
assignment. All the priority queue functions utilize only the list API
functions to do the necassary operations.

A patient header file is created and is used to store information regarding
the patients.

The main uses two data structures one is a PriorityQueue and another one is a
linkedList. The priority queue is used to process the data from the user
and the linked list is used to display the final output to the user in the
required format.

In the main program loop pressing 1 will prompt the user to enter another patient.
Pressing 2 will run the simulation, after the simulation finished the user can enter anything and press ENTER to exit the program.
Pressing 3 in the main loop will exit the program without running the simulation.


The starvation algorithm is implemented in a different c file
This is so that the main simulation can be run first to ensure it works properly

#####################

To run the main program:
- make and change directory to bin and run using ./main <file_name>

To run test program:
- make and change directory to bin and run using ./testMain

To run the program with the starvation algorithm:
- make and change directory to bin and run using ./starveMain <file_name>

make clean - to clean object and binary file

Testing files for the simulation are located in the assets folder

Stravation algorithm:

Every 15 seconds in the simulation the priority of 3 patients in for all patients with
priority greater than 2 is decreased by 1.
If a patient with priority 4 waits for 15 seconds then his priority will now decrease to 3.
This occurs for 3 patients in all priorities greater than 2.
This ensures that patients with low prioties don't have to wait too long in the line

#####################

All the patients are assumed to arrive a the same time, that is, a time of 0.
The simulation is not real time and it starts at time 1 and then continues
until all patients have been treated by the doctor.
After a patient has been treated the doctor takes 1 second to do paperwork
before he can deal with the next one.
The patient id can have a maximum length of 99 characters
