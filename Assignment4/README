The program checks if the user has entered the proper files name.
If file does not exist then the user is prompted to enter a file name until 
a proper file name has been entered.

The program is a very basic version of Siri or google home. Rule will be read from a file.
Rules can also be added and removed by the user. The program will ask the user what they
want to talk about and will provide a right answer if it finds a match in the binary tree
The binary tree is used to store all the rules and most of the binary tree api functions in this assignment
have been implemented recursively



In the main program loop pressing 
1) Will prompt the user to add a rule
2) Will prompt the user to remove a rule
3) Will print all the rules present
4) Will prompt the user to modify an existing rule
5) Will discuss anything with the user
9) Will exit the program


#####################

To run the main program:
- make and change directory to bin and run using ./main <file_name>

To run test program:
- make and change directory to bin and run using ./testMain

make clean - to clean object and binary file

Testing files for the simulation are located in the assets folder

#####################

Personalization:

The system rating rule has not been modified, but the maximum system rating has been capped to 0.98 and the minimum
rating for a rule has been capped to 0.10. This is because the rule will increase extremely slowly at 0 and will
decrease extremely slowly at a value of 1


#####################

All the keywords for the rules are stored in lowercase.
The maximum length for the responses is 399 characters long
